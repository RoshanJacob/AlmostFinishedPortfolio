      <p>
        I am a student taking a course in whitehatjr. and have completed 72
        classes so far.
        I have my own website and have designed many games and websites.
        I have also created a multiplayer game in which people can join with
        just an internet connection and can race each other in a seperate
        car assigned to them.
